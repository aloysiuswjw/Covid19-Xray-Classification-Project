### Covid19 Xray Classification Project
> [!NOTE]
> - Performed Exploratory data analysis(EDA) to distil insightful characteristics and produce visual representations from these images.
> - Comparison using CNN vs Traditional Learning Classifier(Most Accurate).
> - Tested on unseen data for accuracy test.
> - Experimented on:
>   - CNN
>   - Deep Learning
>     - ResNet(Residual Networks)
>     - DenseNet(Densely Connected Convolutional Networks)
>     - Inception Networks
>     - Effcient Net
>     - VGGNet
>     - MobileNet
>   - Traditional Learning Classifier
>     - Support Vector Machine Classifier
>     - Random Forest Classifier
